## üöÄ Quickstart

Here‚Äôs a minimal example to get started with QNN:

```python
import numpy as np
from qnn import Sequential, QuantumLayer, Adam

# Generate synthetic data
X = np.random.rand(100, 4)
y = np.random.randint(0, 3, size=100)  # 3-class classification

# Define the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(QuantumLayer(input_size=4, output_size=3, dropout_rate=0.1))
model.compile(loss='crossentropy', optimizer='adam', learning_rate=0.001)

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=16)

# Evaluate
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X, y)
print(f"Loss: {loss}, Accuracy: {accuracy}")

# Predict
predictions = model.predict(X[:5])
print("Predictions:", predictions)
```
